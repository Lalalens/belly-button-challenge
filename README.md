## Overview

The Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard is an interactive tool designed to explore the fascinating Belly Button Biodiversity dataset. This dataset catalogs the microbes, or operational taxonomic units (OTUs), that inhabit human navels, revealing the remarkable microbial diversity found there.

The dataset uncovers a fascinating trend: a small handful of microbial species were present in more than 70% of individuals, while the majority of species were relatively rare.

## Features

### Interactive Charts
The dashboard includes several dynamic charts:

**Horizontal Bar Chart:** Displays the top 10 OTUs found in a selected individual's belly button.

**Bubble Chart:** Visualizes each microbial sample collected. The OTU IDs are plotted on the x-axis with the sample values on the y-axis. The marker size and color both correlate with the sample values.

## Metadata Panel
Alongside the charts, the dashboard provides a panel that displays the selected individual's demographic information and other key metadata.

## Usage
To use the dashboard, simply select an individual from the dropdown menu. The charts and metadata panel will update to reflect the data specific to the chosen individual.

## Technology
The Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard uses D3.js to fetch and process the data, and Plotly.js to create and render the interactive charts.
